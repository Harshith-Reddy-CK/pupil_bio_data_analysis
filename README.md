# Pupil Bio Data Analysis 🧬

Welcome to the Pupil Bio Data Analysis repository! This repository contains code and scripts used for the bioinformatics challenge related to identifying somatic mutations and performing quality control for cancer sample analysis.

## ⚡ Overview of Tasks

### 🧑‍🔬 Task 1: Coverage Analysis and Biomarker Identification
This task involves calculating coverage metrics and identifying biomarkers for tissue differentiation.

### 🧪 Task 2: Quality Control, Alignment, and Mutation Calling
This task covers quality control checks, alignment to the human genome, and identifying somatic mutations using custom scripts.

## 🖥️ Scripts Folder

The `scripts` folder contains Python and R scripts that automate the following tasks:

- 🧪 Quality control analysis using FastQC and other tools.
- 🧬 Alignment of sequencing data using tools such as Bowtie2 and BWA.
- 🔬 Mutation calling and somatic mutation identification using custom Python scripts leveraging Samtools and bcftools.
- 📊 Plots and visualizations for quality control and biomarker identification.

The scripts are organized into separate folders for each task, allowing users to easily navigate through the pipeline.

## 🚀 Usage

To use the scripts, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harshith-Reddy-CK/pupil_bio_data_analysis.git
   cd pupil_bio_data_analysis
